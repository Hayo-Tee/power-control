## Project Description

Recently, I purchased a **Cooler Master Stacker 830** case and built a server PC based on the **ASUS Z10PE-D8** motherboard. Since I access the server via **Tailscale**, I faced a challenge â€” how to power on the PC remotely if it is completely turned off at home. There are many solutions available online, but I decided to create my own using **ESPHome** and **ESP32-C3**.

## Key Features

* **Power on the PC**
* **Power off the PC**
* **Force shutdown** (emulation of holding the power button)
* **Restart the PC**
* **Get PC status** (on / off)

## Additional Functionality for Unraid

Since my server runs **Unraid OS**, I added an extra button to control a virtual machine. You can easily repurpose this feature for any other task by modifying the script.

* **Single press** â€” starts the virtual machine
* **Double press** â€” stops the virtual machine
* **Long press** â€” force stops the virtual machine
